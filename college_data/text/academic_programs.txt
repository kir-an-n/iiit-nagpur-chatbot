PROGRAM DETAILS

B.TECH. COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING

Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering is provided at IIIT Nagpur. Computer science students follow an integrated curriculum that includes topics such as programming languages, computer architecture, operating systems, and theoretical foundation of computer science and mathematics. 

Artificial intelligence, natural language processing, computational complexity and algorithm analysis, computer communications, combinatorial methods, databases, optimization, and soft skills, etc. are among the courses covered in upper-level of curriculum. 

Students get the flexibility in a fast changing area as a result of this integrated approach. They are prepared to engage in both applied and theoretical breakthroughs in computer science.

B.TECH. CSE (ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE & MACHINE LEARNING)

A Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning) is one of the most prestigious degrees available in this decade. The goal of the course is to build a solid foundation by using the ideas and technology of Artificial Intelligence, which include logic, knowledge representation, probabilistic models, and machine learning. 

While artificial intelligence aims to simulate human intellect and behaviour, machine learning is a subset of AI that allows a computer system to make predictions or make decisions based on previous data without having to be explicitly programmed. 

Students will learn how to analyze, create, and build knowledge-based and expert systems, as well as Artificial Life and robots, and systems that use neural networks. According to study, roughly 30% of all B2B organizations will use artificial intelligence to improve at least one of their sales processes. This shines light on a critical facet of this field: the market's job requirement. In relative to other traditional engineering professions, a B.Tech. in the subject should yield substantially larger returns.

B.TECH. CSE (DATA SCIENCE & ANALYTICS)

This curriculum is aimed to teach students the fundamentals of computer science and data analytics. It also teaches problem-solving and engineering abilities through the use of computational approaches. 

Students will get the chance to study ideas, tools, and approaches for modelling, analyzing, and discovering usable information for a variety of real-world challenges. They are also urged to provide solutions that use appropriate data visualization approaches to aid decision-making. 

Students will gain programming, statistical, mathematical reasoning, machine learning, knowledge finding, communication, and visualization abilities as a result of this curriculum.

To fulfill its goal, the department has highly skilled faculty, outstanding laboratories, and learning materials. The programs are tailored to meet the industry's ever-changing needs and demands. The emphasis is on comprehensive learning and motivating students to participate meaningfully at all levels.

B.TECH. CSE (HUMAN COMPUTER INTERACTION & GAMING TECHNOLOGY)

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a multidimensional subject of study that focuses on the design of computer technology, specifically the interaction and interface between humans (users) and devices and systems that include or embed computing. 

HCI researches how people use technology artifacts as well as how those artifacts may be made to make them easier to use. To better understand and enhance the design, implementation, application, analysis, and assessment of interactive systems, computer scientists engage with specialists in engineering, psychology, linguistics, and social and system organization in HCI research. 

Computer games have progressed beyond their roots as amusement. Educational games, therapeutic games, simulation games, and gamification of utilitarian applications have all been used by researchers and practitioners in novel ways. Individuals and society gain from gaming researchers producing games and using gaming ideas. In the study of games, human-computer interaction (HCI) is crucial. HCI specialists aid in the design and development of better games by evaluating user characteristics, interactions during gaming, and behavioral consequences of gameplay.

B.TECH. ELECTRONICS & COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING

Department of Electronics and Communication offers a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering. Spherical development of students is achieved by exposing them to the latest curriculum that includes flavors of Embedded systems, Internet of Things, Communication technologies, Control systems, Image and Computer Vision, CMOS design, Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc. 

We always try to cope with the rapidly changing technologies by updating our curriculum every semester. We conduct rigorous lab sessions and projects to strengthen concepts and provide hands-on experience.

B.TECH. ECE (INTERNET OF THINGS)

Internet of Things (IoT) applications enormously increased in the past few years since it has a vast scope of usage. IoT in general refers to a network of internet-connected devices that find various applications in engineering and day to day life. 

When objects are interconnected across the world, it allows people or things using those objects to be connected anytime. As an example, from urban transport to medical devices, home electronics and appliances to cars, heart monitoring implants and many more, all connected things ease human life. 

B.Tech course in ECE (Internet of Things) aims to equip students with a solid theoretical foundation, systematic professional knowledge and strong practical skills in the IoT field. Through this program, the students shall have a thorough knowledge of electronic engineering, computer science and a firm foundation into wireless communication, and computer networks. Moreover, deep knowledge on IoT devices, systems and networks is also included. 

The students will develop strong skills in sensors & instrumentation, chip-design, and privacy & security of IoT.
